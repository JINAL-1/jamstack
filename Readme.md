# Netlify â€“ Jamstack Conference 2020

I had a basic knowledge about javascript through my previous classes and was learning Vanilla Javascript the foundation of Javascript.The things that I hoped to learn were Vue js, React, npm , Gridsome, Vue cli and Angular. 

# Next Js 
I learnt about Next Js which is a React framework. Cassady, the host talked about the improvement that occurred in Next Js recently were she mentions about React fast refresh, it maintains the state of the application while updating the code. According to me Next Js would be a powerful tool in the future as it is the UI framework of React and would be in application more. 
 
# Vue Js
Vue Js is a Progressive JavaScript Framework. The host talks about v-press which is a light weight alternative to viewpress built on Vue 3 and V8 there is a big discussion about the features added. It was difficult to analyse the components that the host was talking about.

# Angular
Angular was discussed they talked about creation of Roadmaps. They are working on developing scully, an open dev tool here the idea is that scully takes an angular application and offers functions like pre-rendering. I am unaware about Angular so I was unable to understand it promptly.
 

#   Reflection
Javascript is the most essential component of web development and The questions that I still have in my mind is that which of them would be a best fit and when should it be used.
